# NASB SmashSpeed Mod

This mod will unlock all jukebox songs , gallery & avatars.

## Installation

_If your game isn't modded with BepinEx, DO THAT FIRST!_
Simply go to the [latest BepinEx release](https://github.com/BepInEx/BepInEx/releases) and extract `BepinEx_x64_VERSION.zip` directly into your game's folder, then run the game once to install BepinEx properly.

Next, go to the [latest release of this mod](https://github.com/orangeswim/Nick_SmashSpeed/releases/tag/stable) and extract the zip in your game's install directory.
This will place the dll in `BepInEx\plugins\`.

That's it!
